# StressClientク
We serve what people wants.


# What is our goal?

Well, i will present myself, i always wanted to be a programmer and here i am working on this, this is a Minecraft Utility Mod, for Anarchy Servers.
This is a Lambda Client fork (Im not taking all of the credits.)

This is just to help new players exiting the spawn of any anarchy server, using our tools.

# What WE offer.

We offer free capes for contributors, and people that deserves respect (A lot of people.).

We also offer quality over all.

# Is this BETTER than some of the clients i used like Impact, Wurst?

I cant say yes or no, you should maybe try and make them only one, Lambda brings an unique system for people to combine their clients, most of the clients out there do that.
And if you prefer StressClient, You can always use only our client 	ヽ(♡‿♡)ノ
